            p Alice has decided to install 4 air conditioning units into the house shown to the left. 
            p The house is made up of cells. An air conditioning unit occupies one cell and cools that cell instantly. The cool air from a cell takes 1 minute to spread to all its neighbouring cells as shown below. The image shows how it takes 3 minutes to cool a small room with one air conditioning unit placed on the cell marked 0. 
            p Task: Place 4 air conditioning units in the house below, so that the entire house is cooled in as little time as possible. Click on the cells to place a unit. Click again to remove the unit. Press submit when you're finished.

            p A robotic vacuum cleaner moves in a room of 6x7 square tiles with walls surrounding it.
            p The robot is always in the middle of a square and is always facing towards on of the four walls. It can be moved according to a program built with these commands:
            p FORWARD - move next to the next tile it is facing 
            p LEFT - turn 90 degress anticlockwise while staying on the same tile.
            p RIGHT - turn 90 degrees clockwise whie staying on the same tile.
            p Assume the robot is to execute the following program: 
            p FORWARD LEFT FORWARD RIGHT FORWARD 
            p Task: In the room to the left, select all the tiles where the robot can start and execute this program without crashing into a wall, no matter which wall it is initially facing. Press submit when you're finished.

            p The king is visiting the royal fountains (the blue circles to the left).
            p He has a command: "I wish to go on a walk between two of my fountains. I will tell you which ones when I arrive. I expect to be able to walk on red carpets between the two fountains. I do not mind whether the first path from my start fountain or the last path to my final fountain has a red carpet or not."
            p Task: Click on the paths between the fountains to lay down the least number of red carpets so that the king's command will be obeyed. Press submit when you're finished.
